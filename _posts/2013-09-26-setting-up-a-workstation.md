This week, several AMC members will be presenting some best-practices for efficient software development. We will first discuss why knowing the UNIX shell is such a crucial part of software development. The second portion will be a introductory presentation of the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php) text editor. We will end with a talk about [git](http://git-scm.com/).

These presentations are designed to give you a solid overview of these tools, so if you are new to all of this, no worries! If you have a Mac or Lunix laptop, feel free to bring it and follow along with the presenters.

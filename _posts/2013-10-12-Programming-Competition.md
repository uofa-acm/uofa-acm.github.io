The ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition is coming up.
Start thinking about teams of exactly 3.

Microsoft will be sponsoring the event, with an engineer being responsible
for scoring.  Additionally, lunch will be provided.

There are rules about the teams, which we are still clarifying with Dr. Homer
and consulting the official rulebook. If you have team that does not consist
only of undergrads, keep posted for rules clarifications.

Otherwise, you can [fill out the entry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QZPbXm4VGunDb70NkRpUELy3SexIcpDlLDLje9HUzrA/viewform)
If there are any problems, we will let you know.

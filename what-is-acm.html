    <h1>Our Chapter</h1>
    <p>We are a club that seeks to facilitate an increased knowledge of various aspects of computer science by encouraging the exploration of the field.  Furthermore, we provide a means of communication, both technical and non-technical, between people interested in computer science. We host weekly tech talks, given by students for students. We are open to all members of the U of A community interested in computer science, not just CS majors.  See our <a href='/talks/'>past talks</a> for an idea of what ACM is all about.</p>

    <p>In addition to our weekly tech talks, we host evens such as the <a href='http://icpc.baylor.edu/'>ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</a>, and the annual ACM hackathon.</p>
